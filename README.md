# In The Clouds

> I created this project after completing a coding bootcamp at Thinkful. This is a personal project for Delta Airlines flight attendants, my former coworkers.

## Project Description

> Each year, I received a .csv file of all the flight data for the flights that I worked that year. I wanted to see what I could create with this data.
> Each line in the file represents a flight segment. These flight segments were grouped by rotation number. I created a Map for each rotation so that I could keep all data together by rotation. The key is the rotation date since the rotation number itself could be duplicated througout the data.
